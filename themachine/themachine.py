"The Machine" implementation of parsing and executing a program.

The application reads a file name from the user and executes the contents of the file or sends an error if the file format is not valid.

The file format is describe in "The Machine" exercise and the lab description.


Introduction: (Describe the lab in your own words)




Summary: (Summarize your experience with the lab, what you learned, what you liked, what you disliked, and any suggestions you have for improvement)
